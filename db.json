      "description": " This was my first day learning React (kinda)....\n\nI started learning by following a React course I bought on Udemy. this one here: React - The Complete Guide.\n\nI bought this course when it was on sale (shocker right?). I’ve been speed running through as much content as possible on 1.5 speed. I’ve made it through a bunch of modules.\nI’ve learned about:\n\n    es-6\n    Spread and rest operators\n    Destructuring\n    Components\n    JSX\n    Functional vs stateful components\n    State\n    React hooks\n    Redux\n\n& a ton more.\n\nThis is a great course, definitely worth the money, but to be honest I am getting a bit bored of watching course modules. Tomorrow I think I will start my first from-scratch react project.",

      "description": "Okay, so today I went hard in the paint.\n\nI basically finished the entire blog detail portion of the app. Now when you click on a blog item from the blog home screen you will be navigated to THIS detail page!...\n\nI struggled for a moment to get everything to look nice on different device sizes (aka make it reactive). But I ended up pulling through. The Material Design library that I am using makes that so much easier. I think it looks pretty good.\n\nI also added Google auth from Firebase, so users can now sign in to the website. The reason I added this is for comments! I added some code so that users who are logged in can leave comments on each blog post. I don’t imagine anyone actually using this, but it was a fun little feature to add and also a great way to showcase my React skillzzz.\n\nWith the implementation of auth, I introduced Redux to the application. This was a great opportunity for me to really learn about Redux and have a practical reason to implement it.",
